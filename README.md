**spoofMe** is a program built in the Python programming language, ideal for spoofing calls and instant messaging (SMS) using SpoofCard.

For the program to function correctly, it is necessary to have an account for the service https://www.spoofcard.com/, as well as to have registered credits, otherwise the procedure will not be carried out correctly.

Currently, the tool has the following utilities:

Instant Messaging (SMS) Spoofing
Phone Call Spoofing
Improvements to incorporate:

Management of telephone calls from terminal.

This version is an updated version to work with the most current version of the website. The previous version is no longer working.
